        We have to begin by loving ourselves, because without having experienced
        this unconditional love and acceptance on a personal level it will be difficult
        to extend it to others. From this point, we can then include those who are special
        to us and eventually all living things. Over time, the visualisation and meditation blend into
        the actual experience – the feeling of loving-kindness.

        Take a comfortable and relaxed posture and bring your focus to the solar plexus (your chest area).
        Breathe in and out from the heart centre and anchor your mindfulness on the sensations coming from there.
        Recognise any areas of mental blockage, numbness, self-judgement or self-hatred and try to generate a kind
        feeling toward yourself. As you keep breathing in and out, repeat affirming phrases, such as ‘may I be happy’
        and ‘may I be healthy and strong’, either in your head or out loud. Choose five that resonate most strongly
        with you, and after saying each one several times, move on to someone in your life who invites the feeling of
        pure unconditional loving-kindness (usually a partner or close relative). Repeat the phrases you used for
        yourself for this person (e.g. ‘may she be safe and protected’) while continuing to breathe from your heart
        centre.
